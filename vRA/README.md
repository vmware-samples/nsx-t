# NSX-T Automation with vRA

## Overview

This repository contains a number of examples showing latest vRA with NSX-T Automation examples. The goal of these examples is to get easily started with a topology and expand the capabilities based on your requirements. 

Each example contains a READMe.md file which explains the example, contains a diagram and describes the feature and requirements. 

In general you need vRA to be configured with NSX-T as an Endpoint. In all examples  it is assumed a Network Profile is ready and tagged with a Capability Tag. 

Each Cloud Template code can be copied to a vRA Cloud Assembly environment and adapted to your environment.

Currently the following examples are available:

- 3-Tier-Application
- Shared Gateway with NAT
- Shared Gateway with Outbound Networks
- Shared Gateway with Routed Networks
- Micro-Segmentation with Outbound Network
